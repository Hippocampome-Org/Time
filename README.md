This framework uses Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to optimize Izhikevich model parameters. 

Required libraries:

1. ECJ (Luke S, et al. (2015). "Ecj: A java-based evolutionary computation research system."
Downloadable versions and documentation can be found at the following url: http://cs. gmu. edu/eclab/projects/ecj.)
2. Apache Commons Mathematics Library (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/)
3. CARLsim (Beyeler M, Carlson KD, Chou TS, Dutt N, Krichmar JL. (2015). 
A User-Friendly and Highly Optimized Library for the Creation of Neurobiologically Detailed Spiking Neural Networks. In International Joint Conference on Neural Networks.)
http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~jkrichma/CARLsim/
(#3 is required only for multi-compartment models)

The following steps assume you are familiar with the required libraries above.

- Constraints are specified in JSON format under input/ directory
- Specify the .json file path in "primary_input" file (comma separated values. See "primary_input")
- Specify the number of compartments (up to 4), and their layout following the file path in primary_input
e.g. 10_2_3,B4,3-000,1,0 will create a single compartment model using the constraints specified in 
input/10_2_3/B4/3-000.json. 
10_2_3,B4,3-000,4,0,0,0,2 will create a 4-compartment model using the same constraints and additional dendritic constraints.
{0,0,0,2} denotes the 4-compartment layout. index (0-based) represents a compartment, and the value represents the compartment which the index is connected to.
0 always represents soma (compartment-0). compartment-1 and compartment-2 (dendrites denoted by indices 1 and 2) are connected to soma. compartment-3 is connected to compartment-2
- The 2nd line in primary_input specifies which simulator to use. ("int" for Java-based ACM library, "ext" for CARLsim)
- Specify the ECJ parameters in .params file under input/ directory
- Once the modules are setup and input is specified, run src\ec\app\izhikevich\starter\ECJStarterV2.java (Or simply run startEA.sh)
- Outputs are generated under output/ directory
- Utility classes are available under src\ec\app\izhikevich\util package to read ECJ-generated output files
- .cpp files for simulating multi-compartment models using CARLsim are located under tuneIzh9p/
